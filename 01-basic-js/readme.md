variable:-

-variable is container to store some data.
-In javascript we have 3 types of variables
1. let
2.var
3.const

1. let:-

-let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
-Now these days , more of the cases we used let for creating variables.
-let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases.

2. var:-

-var is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable later stage.
-var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are don't use var most of the time.

3. const:-
-const is a type of variable where we can't change our data further.
-const means constant to store some data like numbers, integer etc..


task:-
