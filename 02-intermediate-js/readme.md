Array in js :-
-Collection of items.
ex:-
let heros= ["ironman","batman","hulk","thor"];

let marks=[89,56,98,23,90];
let info=["rahul",89,"delhi",90];

-array index starting from 0.
ex:-
arr[0],arr[1],arr[2]....


Looping over the arrays:-
-print the below element in one by one
-let heros = ["ironman","batman","hulk","thor"];
-we will do it through loops.

practice questions:-
1. for a given array with marks of student->[85,97,44,37,76,60].find the average marks of the entire class.
2.for a given array with prices of 5 items->[250,645,300,900,50].all items have an offer of 10% off on them. change the array to store final price after applying offer.
